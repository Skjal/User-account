This is user account manager using Local Storage HTML5 API to simulate data server.


You have to open "login.html" page to make app work correctly.

Built with Twitter Bootstrap.
User profile page is based on Angular.js
Form input fields are validated using regular expression.


This doesn't work in IE and Edge due to local offline page.

PLEASE NOTE:
I was learning basics of Angular.js, Twitter Bootstrap and Regular Expression. This app is the result of it and I didn't care about code, so most of the code is VERY UGLY.
